Functionality: 3
  I have the Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. They work in a command line interface that reads and writes new files.

OOP: 3
  I have 4 classes and 1 module. No class comes even close to being 100 lines long. I do have a few cases where a line is over 80 characters, but just barely. I also have a few cases where the methods stretched to 8 lines, but I do not believe there is anything over 8.

  TDD: 4
    I used test drive development the whole way. I have 100% coverage.

  Version Control: 4
    I have 45 commits, 13 pull requests, and 5 branches. Everything is named and documented clearly. None of my commits have multiple  pieces of functionality.
